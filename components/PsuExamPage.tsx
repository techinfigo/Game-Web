                     In GATE 2025, for multi-session papers, normalization adjusts for variations in question difficulty across sessions. It assumes similar ability distribution among candidates in all sessions, ensured by large candidate numbers and random session allocation. The normalization formula, determined by the committee, is applied to calculate normalized marks.
